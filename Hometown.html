    <h1><b>Home Grown</b></h1>

    <h4>Oil Painting on Canvas, April 2022</h4>

    <p>Home Grown manipulates elements from my childhood and hometown in order 
        to create a landscape painting that pays homage to my childhood and personal identity.
        <b>FUN FACT:</b> I grew up in small little town in Northwest Ohio, called Sherwood.
        My graduating class was less than sixty students.
