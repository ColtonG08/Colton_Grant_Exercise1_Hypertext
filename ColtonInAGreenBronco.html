    <h1><b>Colton In A Green Bronco</b></h1>

    <h4>Digital Art, December 2022</h4>

    <p>Colton In A Green Bronco explores self-portraiture through digital medium, 
        utilizing visual elements and symbols to reference my interest and hobby
        of cars.
        <b>FUN FACT:</b>Growing up as a little kid, my dream job was always to be a car designer.
         A dream of mine is to someday fix up and restore a '72 Ford Bronco.
