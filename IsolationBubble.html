    <h1><b>Isolation Bubble</b></h1>

    <h4>Site-Specific, Dimensions Variable, December 2021</h4>

    <p>Isolation Bubble explores the relationship between space and materials 
        through the idea of every individual being confined to their own personal
        bubble of isolation through fear, anxiety, and worry coming out of a post-pandemic.
        <b>FUN FACT and DISCLAIMER:</b> I had so much fun making this piece and it was my first ever installation work.
        However, I cannot say that no bubble wrap was harmed in the making of this piece.
