    <h1> I'm Colton Grant!</h1>
    <h3>I'm a fourth year art education major here at The Ohio State University.
        There is a world full of <b><a href="MyArtwork.html"> ART </a></b> all around us and as an artist, 
        I explore that world through mixed media, sculpture, painting, and collage. 
        As an art educator, I hope to help my students practice this sentiment and explore 
        all the different ways in which art can be found in our everyday lives. 
        Art allows me to reflect upon my own life, express myself through the world around me, 
        and explore how I personally fit into today's society.  
    </h3>
